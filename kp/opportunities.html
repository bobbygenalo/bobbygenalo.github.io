            One of the most common refrains our project team heard from Physicians was that having someone - or something - else assist with documentation of patient notes would allow them to focus their energy on the practice of medicine as opposed to the practice of charting and billing. Using other members of the care team, we also heard, was deemed cost prohibitive by senior PMG leadership.
