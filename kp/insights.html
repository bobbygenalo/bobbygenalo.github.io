            <h1>We are inundated with information on how to be better. I would say some of the physicians when you give them that data, they say, "Look, I'm trying my best. And it seems like you're always telling me that I'm not good enough and I need to do better."</h1>
              <h2>Family Medicine Physician &amp; PIC, Pasadena</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            As the first few weeks of research and shadowing drew to a close, the project team began regularly sharing their learnings via summarized reports in Slack and memorable quotes in Airtable. We scheduled more formal blocks of time to remotely coalesce around the broadest patterns and insights that we had heard thus far, maturing our shared mental model of where our research was leading us.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-section mb-2em" id='amplifiers'>
          <h1 class="page-section-header">Amplifiers</h1>
          <p>
            One of the first patterns we recognized was that there were likely to be <span class='highlight-text'>many "drivers" of Physician Burnout</span> that would touch upon and amplify several of our emerging Insights. For example, it wouldn't make much sense to have an Insight called "Endless Connectivity" as this is a reality that permeates all professional and personal contexts.

          <div class="flex-wrapper">
            <h1>Access Targets</h1>
            <p>
              There are very real trade-off between access and service, time and quality. Is it possible that KP’s access goals are in inherent conflict with physician sustainability?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-wrapper">
            <h1>Not Enough Time</h1>
            <p>
              Underlying and heightening every other challenge is the issue of time. It’s not only that the amount of time allocated for each in-person appointment and related charting doesn’t feel sufficient  -  it’s also that providers are made late by external forces and can’t catch up. It’s the elephant in the room.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-wrapper">
            <h1>Endless Connectivity</h1>
            <p>
              There are clear benefits, as well as unintended consequences to, endless connectivity. Many physicians feel the “EMR in their pockets,” helps them deliver better care, but being constantly “on” takes a toll on their wellbeing and contributes to unrealistic patient expectations of responsiveness.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-wrapper">
            <h1>Lack of Agency</h1>
            <p>
              In exchange for the sacrifices of medical school and residency, physicians expect to be afforded a certain level of autonomy and agency in their work. Some feel this has eroded to such an extent that the only control they can exert over their situation is to cut back their hours or stop working entirely.
